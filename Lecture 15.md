#. Open

- But $p(U)$ is open when $U$ is "saturated" (if $x$ )

  - Ex:
    $$p: R -> R/Z$$

  - A closed => A Saturated closed

_Example:_
Projective spaces $P^n(\mathbb{R})$, $P^n(\mathbb{C})$ are compact, as quotients of the sphere (and graph...)

## Homotopy:

$$
\pi_1(X) \textrm{ fundamental group}
$$

## One-point compactification
